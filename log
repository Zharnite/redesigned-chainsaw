Starting to work on it today since I was angry and I wanted to do something. 
Today, I worked on it for almost four hours. I did a lot of researching to get the code to work properly. I finally got a button to work and I think I'm done with code for today. I guess today's progress made me less angry, but now I feel tired. Ok, time to work on college applications.

It's 10:55 PM and I'm starting to work on it. I feel guilty for wasting this entire Saturday, so I'll work on this project for a while to get in the mood and then I'll do homework.
So, it's 11:48 PM now. I got the 2d6 dice working quite easily, but the custom took some time. I couldn't get it to work in the same function as my previous dice rolls buttons so I created another function. It doesn't seem efficient and I'm not too satisfied. I'll revisit this when I have time to polish. I also have a lot of renaming to do.
