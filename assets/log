Starting to work on it today since I was angry and I wanted to do something. 
Today, I worked on it for almost four hours. I did a lot of researching to get the code to work properly. I finally got a button to work and I think I'm done with code for today. I guess today's progress made me less angry, but now I feel tired. Ok, time to work on college applications.
